The Polygon Processor (PP) is a processor built from discrete components
   the ALU is provided by a Logic L4C381 (operational equivalent of 4 74381 ALU's to provide 16 bit, with 2 input registers and 1 output register)
   2 * 2 * 74 377 8 bit registers to provide 16 bit registers for pipelined register of ALU outputs ?
   72 bit wide (9 * 2 * 4 bits * 4K) microcode ram
   16 bit wide (4 * 4 bits * 4K) SRAM data memory
   two 16 bit wide (4 * 4 bits * 4K) vertex buffers, the GE can write data into one buffer while the PP works with data in the other
   3 * 74 283 adders for a 12 bit program counter
   3 * 74 258 2 to 1 multiplexer for 12 bit branch address selection
   3 * PAL16R8 for a program stack
   2 * 74 569 up/down counters + another 4 bits of register (PAL16R4?) for a 12 bit memory/vertex pointer
   3 * 74 157 2 to 1 multiplexer for 12 bit memory address selection
   1 * PAL16L4? for condition flag latch and branch condition calculation
   1 * 74 151 8 to 1 multiplexer for branch condition selection
   interface to Edge Processor (EP) and Slope Calculator (SC)

   For purposes of describing the architecture:
     the ALU has two operand registers A and B
     the ALU has an output register F or F0
     the output from the instruction one cycle previous will be called F1
     the output from the instruction two cycles previous will be called F2
     the input to the ALU will be called R
     a command has a word count, register WC, indicating how many words of parameters are in SRAM or the vertex buffer, starting at address 0
     the vertex pointer will be called VP, although it can store a full 12 bits of address
     a vertex consists of eight 16 bit words, nominally {X, Y, Z high word, Z low word, red, green, blue, alpha}
     incrementing the vertex pointer increases by one vertex or eight words
     decrementing the vertex pointer decreases by one vertex or eight words

   The PP can receive commands from either the GE or the GM. Each 8 bit command tag is used as an address into the first 256 instructions
   to give the first instruction for executing that command.
   
   The condition flags for branching are determined by the instruction two cycles previous to the branch instruction.
   Writes to EP registers are from the ALU output two cycles previous, F2

   The GM can read the ALU output (likely F2) at address c800c000

  unknown bits - this is a representation of bits with meaning as yet to be determined
                 the 'n', 's', 'w' and 'z' are for indexing purposes as described in 'Microcode decoding process' section

  imm - the immediate field of the instruction, interpreted as data

  load - ALU load operation

                   a blank field indicates no load operation
    LOAD A         load ALU A register
    LOAD B         load ALU B register
    LOAD AB        load ALU A and B register (does not occur in valid microcode)

  bus op

    r/w            read (to the ALU input bus) or write (from the ALU output)
    I              immediate field
    F1I            ALU output of one cycle previous write to vertex pointer address with lower address bits from immediate field
    F1P            ALU output of one cycle previous write to vertex pointer address
    F1             ALU output of one cycle previous (read to ALU input)
    SVI            SRAM using address of vertex pointer with lower address bits from immediate field
    SVP            SRAM using address of vertex pointer

    VP             the value of the vertex pointer
    WC             the value of the word count register

    when under GM control, VBI and VBP operations appear to be redirected to SRAM and the WC is from the GM PP SRAM word count c8004000
    when under GE control, VBI and VBP operations refer to the vertex buffer and the WC is from the GE PP word count c800a000

  EP - EP register to be written

    x/y/z/r/g/b/a  x, y, z, red, green, blue or alpha DDA unit
            ma lo  'a' side slope, lower bits
            ma hi  'a' side slope, higher bits (not confirmed, EP diagnostic test suggests the registers have 48 bit precision)
            mb lo  'b' side slope, lower bits
            mb hi  'b' side slope, higher bits (not confirmed, EP diagnostic test suggests the registers have 48 bit precision)

    EPmode         EP mode register, keeps track of RGB vs. color index mode, anti-alias (coverage as alpha) mode, pixel buffer operation source
    recip          reciprocal, related to the slope calculator, the individual DDA units receive dr, dg, db, etc. but need dr/dx, dg/dx, db/dx
                   this would usually be set to dx to provide the denominator for these calculations, but also seems capable of providing
		   a means to set the 'a' or 'b' side starting values with more than 16 bit precision for the z unit      
      
  flag - flag control operation

                   a blank field indicates to latch flags of current operation
    hf             hold flags from previous operation, do not latch flags of current operation

  pgram flow - program flow operation, occurs after all other operations, condition determined by instruction two cycles previous
               unless hold flags was used
	       
	           a blank field indicates sequential program flow, no branch or call

    b, c           branch or call no condition
    blteq, clteq   branch or call if less than or equal (sign bit/flag true or zero flag true)
    bgt, cgt       branch or call if greater than, signed comparison (carry flag false)

    blt, clt       branch or call if less than (sign bit/flag true)
    bGM, cGM       branch or call if GM busy (undetermined what indicates the GM is busy)

  GM - GM communication, likely toggles bits in the GM/PP status register cc000000

                   a blank field indicates no operation
                   0 usually at start of PP commands, clear (cc000000) bit 1, PP busy ?
                   1 usually at end of PP commands, set (cc000000) bit 1, PP done ?
                   2 transfer to GM ?
                   3 resume from GM, transfer to GE ?
                   4 used to send PP interrupt
                   5 not used

                   7 used at end of pixel buffer operation




Microcode decoding process

  Originally looking at the 72 bit wide PP microcode from the GM PROM and starting with the knowledge that the first 
0xff instructions are used as a jump table to dispatch commands, the pattern '80 b0 d4 7d 10 fe' is repeated in almost
all instructions.  For these instructions, an increasing sequence, matching the instruction offset was noticed.
The other instructions with '80 b0 dc 3d 10 fe' coincide with the command indices the GM PROM code for the 68020
sends to the PP.  For these instructions the remaining half of the first three columns establishes an instruction
offset for a jump.

Having given an interpretation to the first 24 bits of the instruction, the remaining bits were indexed to allow
text searching as follows:

At this point breaking the instructions at the jump destinations allowed some determination of the instruction bits
specifying program flow.  Looking at the microcode 'ppdiag.u' provided identification of  the bits specifying ALU opcode,
ALU carry input, ALU input loading, branch conditions, vertex pointer (VP) operations, the top 4 bits of the immediate
field and some of the bus routing.  The 'epdiag.u' microcode provided identification of the bits specifying
EP registers.
